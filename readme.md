## RPN Calculator
---

This is a calculator tool that I've developed over the course of my college career. It's based on Reverse Polish notation, and allows for some advanced calculations. It allows you to store variables, calculate vector functions, do unit conversion, and quite a bit more.

The tool allows you to write your calculation on multiple lines, and it lets you print them out (with comments) as they go along.
